# Notes

## Things that might come in handy

- <https://nextra.site/docs> - The framework used to build this app
- <https://ui.shadcn.com/docs> - A UI component library for React
- <https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/> - A library for animations in React

## General to do list

- [ ] Decide whether to have the exercises in the same page as the lessons or in a separate page

- [ ] We need to create a nice looking landing page for the app -> `src/pages/index.mdx`

## Playground for the exercises

- [ ] See: <https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs>
- [ ] See: <https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component>

## Exercises to do list - might become irrelevant ðŸ’¡

- [ ] Add a link in the lesson pages that goes to the corresponding exercise page
- [ ] Refactor the `Quiz` component to use the correct semantic HTML elements
  - using: `form`,`label`,`input`, `radio`;
- [ ] Add a "Validate" button to the `Quiz` component that checks the user's code against the solution

- [ ] Add dark theme support to the `Quiz` component
- [ ] Add modern styling to the `Quiz` component
  - Something in the lines of:
  - margin: 20px 0;
  - border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
  - box-shadow: 0 4px 8px #e5e7eb, 0 5px 10px #e5e7eb;
  - margin-bottom: 48px;
- [ ]
