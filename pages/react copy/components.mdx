# React Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. In modern React development, we primarily use functional components with hooks.

## Functional Components

Functional components are the recommended way to write components in React. They are JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return React elements.

### Basic Syntax

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### Using Arrow Functions

You can also use arrow functions to create functional components:

```jsx
const Welcome = props => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
};
```

### Advantages of Functional Components

- They're easier to read and test.
- They have less boilerplate code.
- They work seamlessly with React's Hooks system for managing state and side effects.

  Functional components with Hooks are the current best practice for writing
  React components. They provide a simpler, more flexible way to write
  components compared to the class-based approach.

## Props

Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only and help make your components reusable.

### Passing Props

In the parent component:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <Welcome name='Sara' />;
}
```

### Receiving Props

In the child component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### Default Props

You can specify default values for props using default parameters in JavaScript:

```jsx
function Welcome({ name = "Guest" }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}
```

<Callout emoji='ðŸ”‘'>
  Remember, props are read-only. A component should never modify its own props.
  If you need to modify data, use state instead (we'll cover this in the Hooks
  section).
</Callout>

## Children Prop

The children prop is a special prop that lets you pass components as data to other components, providing a way to compose components together.

### Basic Usage

```jsx
function Welcome({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Welcome>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my app.</p>
    </Welcome>
  );
}
```

<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
  The children prop is a powerful feature for component composition. However,
  directly manipulating children using the `Children` API is not recommended in
  modern React development.
</Callout>

For more advanced usage of children, including alternatives to direct manipulation, please refer to our detailed guide on [Working with Children in React](/react/children)

<Callout emoji='ðŸš€'>
  When working with children, consider alternatives like exposing multiple
  components, accepting arrays as props, or using render props for
  customization. These approaches often lead to more maintainable and flexible
  code.
</Callout>

### Function as Child

You can also pass a function as children, known as the "render prop" pattern:

```jsx
function Repeat({ numTimes, children }) {
  return (
    <>
      {Array(numTimes)
        .fill()
        .map((_, index) => children(index))}
    </>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Repeat numTimes={10}>
      {index => <div key={index}>This is item {index} in the list</div>}
    </Repeat>
  );
}
```

<Callout emoji='ðŸ§©'>
  Think of the children prop as a way to create "wrapper" components that don't
  know their children ahead of time. It's like creating a picture frame that can
  display any picture you put inside it!
</Callout>

## A Note on Class Components

While class components are still supported in React for backwards compatibility, they are not recommended for new code. All the functionality that was previously only available in class components (like managing state and side effects) can now be achieved in functional components using Hooks, which we'll cover in a later section.

If you encounter class components in older codebases, you can refer to the official React documentation for information on how they work. However, for new development, stick to functional components and hooks.

## Conclusion

Components are the heart of React. Understanding how to create functional components, work with props, and use the children prop is crucial to building React applications. These concepts provide powerful ways to make your components flexible and reusable.

As you continue your React journey, you'll find yourself combining these concepts in increasingly sophisticated ways to create complex, interactive UIs. In the next sections, we'll dive into Hooks, which allow you to add state and side effects to your functional components. Happy coding!
