# Context API & useContext in React

## Brief Overview

<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
  The Context API in React provides a way to pass data through the component
  tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. The useContext
  hook allows functional components to consume this context easily.
</Callout>

## Detailed Explanation

### What is the Context API?

The Context API is a feature in React that allows you to share values like themes, user authentication status, or any other global data across many components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.

### Why does it exist?

The Context API exists to solve the problem of prop drilling - the process of passing props through multiple levels of components that don't need those props themselves but only pass them along to lower components.

### For which purpose?

**The main purposes of the Context API are**:

1. Sharing global data across many components
2. Avoiding prop drilling
3. Providing a way to manage global state in React applications

### Creating Context

To create a context, you use the `createContext` function from React:

```jsx
import React from "react";

const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");
```

### Creating Providers and Consuming Context

A Provider is a React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. Here's an example of creating and using a Provider:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value='dark'>
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useContext Hook

The `useContext` hook provides a way to consume context in functional components:

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from "react";

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button style={{ background: theme }}>I am styled by theme context!</button>
  );
}
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a complete example demonstrating the Context API and useContext:

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

// Create a context
const ThemeContext = createContext();

// Create a provider component
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// A component that consumes the context
function ThemedButton() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <button
      style={{
        background: theme === "light" ? "#fff" : "#000",
        color: theme === "light" ? "#000" : "#fff"
      }}
      onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
    >
      Toggle Theme
    </button>
  );
}

// App component
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <div>
        <h1>My App</h1>
        <ThemedButton />
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Context for Global State**: Context is best for data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components.
2. **Keep Context Usage Simple**: Avoid putting too much data or complex logic in a single context.
3. **Split Contexts**: If you have multiple independent pieces of global state, create separate contexts for each.
4. **Memoize Context Value**: If you're passing objects as context value, consider memoizing them to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
5. **Use Context Judiciously**: While Context can solve prop drilling, it can also make component reuse more difficult. Use it when it genuinely simplifies your code.

## Common Pitfalls

<Callout>

1. Overusing Context:

   - Mistake: Using Context for every piece of shared state.
   - Why: This can lead to performance issues and make components less reusable.
   - Solution: Use Context for truly global state, and consider component composition or lifting state up for more localized sharing.

</Callout>

<Callout>

2. Ignoring Re-renders:

   - Mistake: Not considering that all consumers will re-render when the context value changes.
   - Why: This can lead to performance issues in large applications.
   - Solution: Use memoization techniques (like useMemo) for context values, and split contexts if necessary.

</Callout>

<Callout>

3. Forgetting to Wrap Providers:

   - Mistake: Not wrapping components that need access to the context with the Provider.
   - Why: Components outside the Provider can't access the context.
   - Solution: Ensure that all components that need access to the context are descendants of a Provider component.

</Callout>

<Callout>

4. Modifying Context Value Directly:
   - Mistake: Changing the context value without using setState or a similar method.
   - Why: This won't trigger re-renders in consuming components.
   - Solution: Always use state updating methods (like those returned by useState) to modify context values.

2. **useReducer**: Often used with Context for more complex state management.
3. **Prop Drilling**: The problem that Context aims to solve.
4. **Higher-Order Components**: An alternative pattern for sharing behavior between components.
5. **Render Props**: Another pattern for sharing code between React components.
