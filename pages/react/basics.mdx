# React Basics

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Let's explore some fundamental concepts.

## Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They can be functional or class-based.

### Functional Components

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

### Class Components

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}

export default Greeting;
```

  Functional components are now preferred over class components due to the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8.

## JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>;
```

JSX can include expressions:

```jsx
const name = 'John Doe';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

## Props

Props are inputs to components. They are passed down from parent to child components.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

## State

State is used for data that changes over time within a component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
