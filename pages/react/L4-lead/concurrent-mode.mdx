# Concurrent Mode in React

## Brief Overview

<Callout emoji='💡'>
  Concurrent Mode is a set of new features in React that help apps stay
  responsive and gracefully adjust to the user's device capabilities and network
  speed. It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a
  high-priority event, making apps more responsive.
</Callout>

## Detailed Explanation

### Concurrent Rendering

Concurrent rendering is the core feature of Concurrent Mode. It allows React to work on multiple versions of the UI at the same time, which enables several key capabilities:

1. **Interruptible Rendering**: React can pause rendering work to handle more urgent updates, then resume where it left off.

2. **Prioritization**: Different updates can be assigned different priorities, ensuring that high-priority updates (like user input) are processed quickly.

3. **Suspense**: Allows components to "wait" for something before rendering, with the ability to show fallback content during the wait.

4. **Progressive Loading**: The ability to show a more complete version of the content as more data streams in, rather than an all-or-nothing approach.

Key Concepts:

- **Time Slicing**: The ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
- **Suspense**: A mechanism for declaratively specifying loading states in the UI.
- **Concurrent Renders**: The ability to render multiple versions of a component tree simultaneously.

<Callout emoji='⚠️'>
  Concurrent Mode is still an experimental feature. Always check the latest
  React documentation for the current status and best practices.
</Callout>

## Code Examples

### Basic Usage of Concurrent Mode

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <SlowComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

root.render(<App />);
```

### Prioritizing Updates

```jsx
import React, { useState, useTransition } from "react";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  function handleClick() {
    startTransition(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
      {isPending ? " Loading..." : null}
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Suspense for Data Fetching

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { fetchUser } from "./api";

const resource = fetchUser();

function ProfileDetails() {
  const user = resource.read();
  return <h1>{user.name}</h1>;
}

function ProfilePage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading profile...</h1>}>
      <ProfileDetails />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Suspense Boundaries Wisely**: Place Suspense boundaries strategically to create a good loading experience.

2. **Leverage useTransition**: Use `useTransition` for updates that may take a while but don't need to block the UI.

3. **Implement Progressive Loading**: Design your app to show increasingly complete content as data loads.

4. **Prioritize Critical Updates**: Use concurrent features to ensure that critical user interactions remain responsive.

5. **Test Thoroughly**: Concurrent Mode can introduce new edge cases. Test your app thoroughly, especially under poor network conditions.

6. **Consider Server-Side Rendering**: Concurrent Mode works well with server-side rendering for even better performance.

7. **Profile and Optimize**: Use React's profiling tools to identify and optimize rendering bottlenecks.

## Common Pitfalls

<Callout>

1. Overusing Suspense:

   - Mistake: Wrapping every component in Suspense.
   - Why: This can lead to a poor user experience with too many loading indicators.
   - Solution: Use Suspense judiciously, typically at layout boundaries.

</Callout>

<Callout>

2. Ignoring Error Boundaries:

   - Mistake: Not using Error Boundaries with Suspense.
   - Why: This can lead to uncaught errors and broken UI states.
   - Solution: Always pair Suspense with Error Boundaries for robust error handling.

</Callout>

<Callout>

3. Misunderstanding Transitions:

   - Mistake: Using transitions for every state update.
   - Why: Some updates should be immediate for a responsive feel.
   - Solution: Use transitions only for updates that may take a while but shouldn't block the UI.

</Callout>

<Callout>

4. Neglecting Traditional Optimization Techniques:
   - Mistake: Relying solely on Concurrent Mode for performance.
   - Why: Concurrent Mode is not a silver bullet for all performance issues.
   - Solution: Continue to use traditional optimization techniques alongside Concurrent Mode features.
