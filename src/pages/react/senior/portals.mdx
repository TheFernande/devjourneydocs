# Portals in React

## Brief Overview

<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
  Portals in React provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists
  outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. This allows for more
  flexible rendering of components, especially useful for modals, tooltips, and
  other overlay-style UI elements.
</Callout>

## Detailed Explanation

### What are Portals? Why do we need them?

Portals are a feature in React that allows you to render a component's children into a different part of the DOM tree, outside of the component's own hierarchy.

**We need Portals for several reasons**:

1. **Breaking Out of Container**: Sometimes, a component needs to visually "break out" of its container. For example, modals, tooltips, or floating menus.

2. **Avoiding CSS Limitations**: Portals can help overcome CSS limitations related to stacking contexts and z-index.

3. **Rendering to Different Parts of the DOM**: In some cases, you might need to render content to a specific part of the DOM for semantic or accessibility reasons.

4. **Avoiding Conflicts**: Portals can help avoid conflicts with parent component's CSS or layout.

### Rendering children into different DOM subtrees

Portals allow you to render children into a different DOM subtree while maintaining the React component hierarchy. This means:

1. The portal component still exists in the React component tree, maintaining context and event bubbling.
2. The rendered output appears in a different place in the actual DOM.

The syntax for creating a portal is:

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
```

Where `child` is any renderable React child, and `container` is a DOM element.

## Code Examples

### Basic Portal Example

Here's a simple example of a modal using a Portal:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function Modal({ children, onClose }) {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    <div className='modal-overlay'>
      <div className='modal-content'>
        {children}
        <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
      </div>
    </div>,
    document.body
  );
}

function App() {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setShowModal(true)}>Show Modal</button>
      {showModal && (
        <Modal onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}>
          <h2>This is a modal</h2>
          <p>It's rendered outside the App component's DOM tree.</p>
        </Modal>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Portal with Event Bubbling

This example demonstrates how events from portals bubble up through the React tree:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function Child() {
  return (
    <div className='modal'>
      <button>Click</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function Parent() {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = React.useState(0);
  const handleClick = () => setClicks(c => c + 1);

  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick}>
      <p>Number of clicks: {clicks}</p>
      {ReactDOM.createPortal(<Child />, document.body)}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, clicking the button inside the portal will increment the click count in the parent component, demonstrating that event bubbling works through portals.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Portals Sparingly**: Only use portals when necessary, such as for modals, tooltips, or floating menus.

2. **Keep Accessibility in Mind**: Ensure that content rendered through portals is still accessible, especially for screen readers.

3. **Manage Focus**: When using portals for modals or dialogs, manage focus correctly for keyboard navigation.

4. **Clean Up**: Always clean up and unmount portals when they're no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.

5. **Consider Server-Side Rendering**: Be aware that portals may require special handling in server-side rendering scenarios.

6. **Maintain React's Unidirectional Data Flow**: Even though the DOM structure changes, maintain React's principles of unidirectional data flow.

## Common Pitfalls

<Callout>

1. Overusing Portals:

   - Mistake: Using portals for layout purposes when CSS could solve the problem.
   - Why: This can complicate your component structure unnecessarily.
   - Solution: Only use portals when you need to break out of the DOM hierarchy for a specific reason.

</Callout>

<Callout>

2. Forgetting About Event Bubbling:

   - Mistake: Assuming events in portals are isolated from the rest of the app.
   - Why: Events from portals still bubble up through the React component tree.
   - Solution: Be aware of event bubbling and handle events appropriately.

</Callout>

<Callout>

3. Not Cleaning Up Portals:

   - Mistake: Failing to unmount or clean up portals when they're no longer needed.
   - Why: This can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
   - Solution: Always ensure portals are properly unmounted and cleaned up.

</Callout>

<Callout>

4. Ignoring Accessibility:
   - Mistake: Not considering accessibility when using portals.
   - Why: Content in portals can be difficult for screen readers to navigate.
   - Solution: Ensure proper ARIA attributes and focus management for portal content.

## Related Concepts

1. **React.createRef**: Often used to get references to DOM nodes for portal targets.
2. **useEffect Hook**: Useful for managing the lifecycle of portals in functional components.
3. **Event Bubbling**: Understanding how events bubble through portals is crucial.
4. **React Context**: Context still works as expected through portals.
5. **CSS Stacking Contexts**: Portals can help manage complex stacking contexts.
