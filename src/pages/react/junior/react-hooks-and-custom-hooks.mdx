# React Hooks and Custom Hooks

## Brief Overview

<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
  React Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle
  features from functional components. They enable you to use state and other
  React features without writing a class. Custom Hooks allow you to extract
  component logic into reusable functions.
</Callout>

## Detailed Explanation

### What is what?

1. **React Hooks**: Built-in functions provided by React to add state and lifecycle features to functional components (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.).

2. **Custom Hooks**: User-defined functions that leverage one or more React Hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components.

### Why and how to use each one?

1. **useState**:

   - Why: To add state to functional components.
   - How: `const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);`

2. **useEffect**:

   - Why: To perform side effects in functional components.
   - How: `useEffect(() => { /* effect */ }, [dependencies]);`

3. **useContext**:

   - Why: To consume context in functional components.
   - How: `const value = useContext(MyContext);`

4. **useReducer**:

   - Why: For complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values.
   - How: `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);`

5. **useCallback**:

   - Why: To memoize functions for performance optimization.
   - How: `const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { /* function */ }, [dependencies]);`

6. **useMemo**:

   - Why: To memoize expensive computations.
   - How: `const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);`

7. **useRef**:
   - Why: To persist values across renders without causing re-renders.
   - How: `const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);`

### In which context?

- Hooks are used in functional components to add features that were previously only available in class components.
- They are used throughout a React application for state management, side effects, context consumption, and performance optimization.

### For what purpose?

- To simplify component logic and make it more readable.
- To reuse stateful logic between components without changing component hierarchy.
- To split one complex component into smaller functions based on related pieces.
- To use React features without classes, making the code more concise and easier to understand.

### What value do these bring to our codebase?

- Improved code reusability and organization.
- Reduced complexity compared to class components and lifecycle methods.
- Easier to test and maintain due to separation of concerns.
- Better performance optimization capabilities.
- More intuitive sharing of stateful logic between components.

### Creating custom hooks

Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that use one or more React hooks. They allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions.

Example of a custom hook:

```jsx
function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  }, []);

  return width;
}
```

### Reusing logic across components

Custom hooks allow you to reuse logic across multiple components without changing their structure.

Example of reusing the custom hook:

```jsx
function WindowWidth() {
  const width = useWindowWidth();
  return <div>Window width: {width}</div>;
}

function AnotherComponent() {
  const width = useWindowWidth();
  return <div>The window is {width > 1000 ? "large" : "small"}</div>;
}
```

### Best practices for custom hooks

1. **Name custom hooks with 'use' prefix**: This convention helps identify hooks and ensures the rules of hooks are enforced.

2. **Keep hooks focused**: Each custom hook should have a single responsibility.

3. **Compose hooks**: Build complex custom hooks by composing simpler ones.

4. **Handle cleanup**: If your custom hook sets up subscriptions or timers, make sure to clean them up.

5. **Use TypeScript**: Define clear interfaces for your custom hooks to improve usability and catch errors early.

6. **Document your hooks**: Provide clear documentation on what the hook does, its parameters, and return values.

7. **Test your hooks**: Write unit tests for your custom hooks to ensure they behave correctly.

## Code Examples

### Basic useState Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Explanation:

- This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `useState` hook.
- `useState(0)` initializes a state variable `count` with an initial value of 0.
- It returns an array with two elements: the current state value (`count`) and a function to update it (`setCount`).
- The `onClick` handler uses `setCount` to increment the count by 1 each time the button is clicked.
- React re-renders the component after each state update, displaying the new count.

### useEffect for Data Fetching

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once on mount

  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```

Explanation:

- This example shows how to use `useEffect` for data fetching.
- `useState(null)` initializes a `data` state variable to store the fetched data.
- `useEffect` is used to perform the side effect of fetching data.
- The empty dependency array `[]` ensures that the effect only runs once when the component mounts.
- While data is being fetched (when `data` is still null), a loading message is displayed.
- Once data is fetched, it's displayed by converting it to a JSON string.
- This pattern is common for handling asynchronous operations in functional components.

### Custom Hook Example

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
}

// Usage
function SearchComponent() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");
  const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedSearchTerm) {
      // Perform search here
    }
  }, [debouncedSearchTerm]);

  return (
    <input
      value={searchTerm}
      onChange={e => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
      placeholder='Search...'
    />
  );
}
```

Explanation:

- This example demonstrates creating and using a custom hook `useDebounce`.
- `useDebounce` takes a value and a delay, and returns a debounced version of the value.
- Inside `useDebounce`, `useEffect` sets up a timer that updates the debounced value after the specified delay.
- The cleanup function in `useEffect` clears the timeout if the value changes before the delay has passed.
- In `SearchComponent`, `useDebounce` is used to create a debounced version of the search term.
- This prevents the search from being performed on every keystroke, instead waiting for a pause in typing.
- The `useEffect` in `SearchComponent` will only trigger a search when the debounced search term changes.
- This pattern is useful for performance optimization in scenarios like search inputs or auto-saving forms.

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the Rules of Hooks**: Only call Hooks at the top level and only from React function components or custom Hooks.

2. **Keep Hooks Simple**: Each Hook should ideally do one thing well.

3. **Memoize Expensive Computations**: Use useMemo for expensive calculations to prevent unnecessary re-computation.

4. **Optimize Event Handlers**: Use useCallback to memoize event handlers when passing them to optimized child components.

5. **Prefer Hooks Over HOCs and Render Props**: Hooks often provide a simpler way to reuse logic compared to these patterns.

## Common Pitfalls

<Callout>

1. Ignoring Dependencies:

   - Mistake: Not including all necessary dependencies in useEffect's dependency array.
   - Why: This can lead to stale closures and bugs that are hard to track down.
   - Solution: Use the exhaustive-deps ESLint rule and include all variables from the component scope that the effect uses.

</Callout>

<Callout>

2. Overusing useEffect:

   - Mistake: Using useEffect for synchronous operations that could be done directly in the render phase.
   - Why: This can lead to unnecessary re-renders and complicates the component logic.
   - Solution: Only use useEffect for side effects and asynchronous operations.

</Callout>

<Callout>

3. Incorrect Dependency Array in useMemo and useCallback:

   - Mistake: Not including all dependencies or including unnecessary ones.
   - Why: This can lead to unexpected behavior or negate the performance benefits.
   - Solution: Carefully consider what the callback or computation depends on.

</Callout>

<Callout>

4. Creating Hooks Inside Components:
   - Mistake: Defining custom hooks inside component functions.
   - Why: This creates a new hook on every render, defeating the purpose of hooks.
   - Solution: Always define custom hooks outside of and before your component functions.

</Callout>
