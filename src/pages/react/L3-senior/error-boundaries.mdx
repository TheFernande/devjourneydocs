# Error Boundaries in React (Functional Components)

## Brief Overview

<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
  Error Boundaries in React are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere
  in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI
  instead of the component tree that crashed. While React doesn't provide a
  built-in hook for error boundaries, we can use third-party libraries to
  implement them in functional components.
</Callout>

## Detailed Explanation

### Catching JavaScript Errors

Error Boundaries in React are designed to catch errors that occur during rendering, in effects, and in custom hooks of components. They work like a JavaScript `catch {}` block, but for components.

**Key points about Error Boundaries**:

1. They catch errors in their child components.
2. They do not catch errors in event handlers.
3. They do not catch errors in asynchronous code (e.g., `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks).
4. They do not catch errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children).

To create an Error Boundary with functional components, we'll use the `react-error-boundary` library, which provides a `useErrorBoundary` hook and an `ErrorBoundary` component.

### Fallback UI

When an error is caught, an Error Boundary can render a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. This allows you to provide a better user experience by displaying an error message or a simplified version of the UI, rather than a completely broken page.

## Code Examples

### Basic Error Boundary

Here's how to implement an Error Boundary using the `react-error-boundary` library:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";

function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {
  return (
    <div role='alert'>
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      <button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary
      FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
      onReset={() => {
        // Reset the state of your app here
      }}
    >
      <ComponentThatMightThrow />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}

// Usage
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Error Boundary with Logging

Here's an example that includes error logging:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";

function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {
  return (
    <div role='alert'>
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      <button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function logError(error, info) {
  // Log the error to an error reporting service
  console.error("Caught an error:", error, info);
}

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary
      FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
      onReset={() => {
        // Reset the state of your app here
      }}
      onError={logError}
    >
      <ComponentThatMightThrow />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Multiple Error Boundaries**: Place Error Boundaries strategically to isolate different parts of your application.

2. **Provide Meaningful Error Messages**: Make sure your fallback UI provides useful information to the user.

3. **Log Errors**: Use the `onError` prop to log errors to an error reporting service.

4. **Graceful Degradation**: Design your fallback UI to allow users to continue using other parts of the application if possible.

5. **Don't Overuse**: Error Boundaries are for unexpected errors. Don't use them for control flow.

6. **Test Error Scenarios**: Deliberately cause errors in your components to ensure your Error Boundaries work as expected.

## Common Pitfalls

<Callout>

1. Trying to Catch Event Handler Errors:

   - Mistake: Expecting Error Boundaries to catch errors in event handlers.
   - Why: Error Boundaries only catch errors during rendering, in effects, and in custom hooks.
   - Solution: Use try-catch blocks in event handlers.

</Callout>

<Callout>

2. Placing Error Boundary Too High:

   - Mistake: Wrapping the entire application in a single Error Boundary.
   - Why: This can lead to the entire app being replaced by the fallback UI even for small, isolated errors.
   - Solution: Use multiple Error Boundaries to isolate different parts of your app.

</Callout>

<Callout>

3. Not Providing Enough Information:

   - Mistake: Showing a generic error message without any context or recovery options.
   - Why: This can frustrate users and make debugging difficult.
   - Solution: Provide meaningful error messages and, if possible, ways for the user to recover or report the error.

</Callout>

<Callout>

4. Forgetting to Reset Error State:
   - Mistake: Not providing a way to reset the error state when attempting to recover.
   - Why: This can lead to the fallback UI being stuck even after the error condition might have been resolved.
   - Solution: Implement a reset mechanism, like the `resetErrorBoundary` function provided by react-error-boundary.

## Related Concepts

1. **Error Handling in JavaScript**: Understanding how errors propagate in JavaScript is crucial for effective use of Error Boundaries.
2. **React Hooks**: Error Boundaries with functional components rely on hooks and custom hooks.
3. **React Component Composition**: Error Boundaries rely on component composition.
4. **Defensive Programming**: Error Boundaries are a form of defensive programming in React applications.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Error Boundaries are often used in conjunction with error monitoring and logging services.
